# Personal Portfolio Website  

This is my **Personal Portfolio Website**, created using **HTML** and **CSS**. I used a sample portfolio template from GitHub as a base and customized 
it with my own content and information. This project helped me learn and understand the basics of web development while experimenting with code.  

## Features 
- **About Section**: A brief introduction about me and my skills.  
- **Projects Section**: Displays my work and projects.  
- **Contact Section**: Includes contact details and social media links.  
- **Simple and Clean Design**: User-friendly and visually appealing layout.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the webpage.  
- **CSS**: Used for styling and designing the layout.  

## How I Customized It  
1. **Information Update**: I replaced the default information in the template with my personal details, projects, and contact info.  
2. **Styling Adjustments**: Made minor CSS tweaks to better match my preferences.  
3. **Learning Purpose**: Focused on understanding the structure and styles of a portfolio while editing the existing code.
